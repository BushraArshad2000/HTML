<p> <b>1–6: Fruits and berries
    Fruits and berries are popular health foods.
    
    They are sweet, nutritious, and easy to incorporate into your diet because they require little to no preparation.
    <ol>
        <li>Apples
            Apples contain fiber, vitamin C, and numerous antioxidants. They are very filling and make the perfect snack if you’re hungry between meals.</li>
            <li>Avocados
                Avocados are different from most other fruits because they contain lots of healthy fat. They are not only creamy and tasty but also high in fiber, potassium, and vitamin C. Swap mayonnaise for avocado as a salad dressing, or spread it on toast for breakfast.
                </li>
    </ol>
    
    
    
    3. Bananas
 <ol> <li>Bananas are a good source of potassium. They’re also high in vitamin B6 and fiber and are convenient and portable.
</li></ol> 
    4. Blueberries
    Blueberries are both delicious and high in antioxidants.
    
    5. Oranges
    Oranges are well known for their vitamin C content. What’s more, they’re high in fiber and antioxidants.<b></p>
